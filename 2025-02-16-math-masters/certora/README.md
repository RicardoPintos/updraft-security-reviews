# Certora Formal Verification for `MathMasters.sol`

## Overview

This directory contains the Certora configuration and specification files used to verify the `MulWadUp` and `Sqrt` functions in `MathMasters.sol`, an arithmetic library for fixed-point operations.

Since `MathMasters.sol` is a library with internal functions, we use `Harness.sol` as a wrapper to expose the functions for verification.
